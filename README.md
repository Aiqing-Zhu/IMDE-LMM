# PyTorch Implementation of: Error analysis based on inverse modified differential equations for discovery of dynamics using linear multistep methods and deep learning

## Requirements 
* Python 
* torch
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Reproducing the results of the paper
In general all parameters which need to be specified are given in the paper. The code for our experiments is implemented on [PyTorch framework](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJJsrmfCZ) with Tesla P40 GPU.
